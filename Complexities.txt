Knapsack :
Time Complexity: 
O(n×W)
Space Complexity: 
O(n×W)

n is the number of items
W is the maximum capacity of the knapsack

Huffman Coding :
>Time complexity of the Huffman coding algorithm is:
O(n+klogk)
where 
n is the length of the input string and 
k is the number of unique characters.

>space complexity of the algorithm is:
O(k)
since each data structure (priority queue, frequency map, Huffman Tree, and code map) depends on the number of unique characters 'k'

NQueens Problem:
>Time Complexity: Exponential in nature, since we are trying out all ways. To be precise it goes as O(N! )

QuickSort:

>Time Complexity:

Best Case: (O(n log n)) , Occurs when the pivot element divides the array into two equal halves.
Average Case (O(n log n)) , On average, the pivot divides the array into two parts, but not necessarily equal.
Worst Case: (O(n²)), Occurs when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot (e.g., sorted arrays).

>Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Blockchain is a system for securely storing and sharing information across many computers. It works like a digital ledger, where transactions (or data) are recorded in "blocks," and each block is linked to the previous one, forming a chain.

Key Points:

Decentralized: No single person or organization controls it. It's shared by many computers.
Secure: Once data is added, it can't be changed, making it tamper-proof.
Transparent: Everyone can see the same data, ensuring trust.

How It Works:
Transactions happen (e.g., sending money).
Verified by multiple computers.
Added to the blockchain as a new block, linked to the previous one.

MetaMask is a wallet to store and interact with Ether and other assets.
Ether (ETH) is the cryptocurrency used to pay for transactions and gas on the Ethereum blockchain.

Why smart?
Trackable and irreversible=Once completed, smart contract transactions are irreversible and can be tracked. 

No third party=Smart contracts don't require a third party, like a lawyer or notary, to attest to their validity. 

 Tamper-proof==Smart contracts are stored on a blockchain, which is a distributed database that makes it difficult to change the terms of the
